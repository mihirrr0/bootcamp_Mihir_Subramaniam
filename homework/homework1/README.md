# S&P 500 Volume Seasonality Classification
**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)  

## Problem Statement
Trading volume plays a big role in how liquid a stock is and how the market behaves around it. In the S&P 500, certain months can see noticeably higher or lower volumes and these patterns can differ by sector. Things like earnings seasons, product launches or even broader market sentiment can drive these volume changes.  

The idea here is to study these patterns in a simple and structured manner. By looking at historical data, we can classify which months tend to be “high volume” versus “low volume” for each stock or sector and see whether certain industries follow repeatable seasonal trends. This could help analysts and traders quickly spot months that historically have more activity for an individual stock or sector making it easier to plan strategies or anticipate liquidity shifts. Moreover, the insights can support portfolio managers in planning liquidity around earnings seasons or deciding when to allocate more attention to particular sectors.  

## Stakeholder & User
- **Stakeholders:** Primarily Equity analysts, traders and portfolio managers.  
- **End Users:** Anyone analyzing or trading S&P 500 stocks or sectors who wants insights into timing and liquidity trends which also includes the stakeholders mentioned before.  
- **Decision Window:** Fits into monthly or quarterly strategy reviews and can be referenced when deciding trade timing as the mentioned stakeholders don’t need this info every second and only need it when they review trading strategies for the next month or quarter.  

## Useful Answer & Decision
- **Type:** Descriptive → Predictive  
  The answer will be descriptive at first providing a clear month by month seasonal profile for each sector or stock and later it will be predictive where a model classifies a future month as “high” or “low” volume for a given stock based on past trends that were analyzed.  

- **Output:**  
  - Metrics: accuracy, seasonal correlation  
  - Working artifact: an interactive dashboard  

## Assumptions & Constraints
- “High” vs. “low” volume will be based on the median monthly volume for each stock, since the mean is more susceptible to outliers.  
- Using at least 5 years of data for a meaningful seasonality check.  
- Data cleaning will be needed for ticker changes, stock splits and new listings.  
- Data is sourced from public and free apis, so no compliance restrictions.  
- The decision window is monthly/quarterly, so data latency is not a major issue.  

## Known Unknowns / Risks
- Seasonal trends may evolve or weaken over years. 
- Historical OHLCV data from yahoo finance/alpha vantage may have gaps.  
- Some sectors might not have strong seasonal patterns.  
- Missing history for companies that joined the index recently.  
- Outlier months from unusual events like mergers, product launches etc may skew results.  

## Lifecycle Mapping
- Identify seasonal volume patterns in stock and sectors (project goal) → Problem Framing & Scoping → Scoping paragraph + plan  
- Aggregate and clean S&P 500 data → Data Acquisition/Preprocessing → complete monthly volume dataset ready for EDA.  
- Build classification model → Modeling & Evaluation → model that works accurately backed by test data metrics.  
- Communicate patterns → Reporting → Stakeholder dashboard/report.  
- Deploy dashboard → Productization & Monitoring → Live visualization tool.  

## Repo Plan
- **/data/** → Stores datasets in both raw and processed form. Raw data should be kept intact while cleaned and aggregated data can be saved separately for analysis. (No pushing of sensitive files)  
- **/src/** → Contains reusable Python scripts and helper functions for tasks like data cleaning, feature engineering and model training.  
- **/notebooks/** → Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA), experiments and prototyping. Numbered or clearly named to track the workflow (e.g., 01_eda.ipynb, 02_modeling.ipynb).  
- **/docs/** → Project documentation and stakeholder facing artifacts such as memos, design notes or one-pager summaries. This folder can also hold images or visuals used in reports.  
- **README.md** → Includes the scoping paragraph, lifecycle mapping, repo plan and instructions for navigating the repository.  

**Updates will be daily/weekly**
