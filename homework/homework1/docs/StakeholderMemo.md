# Stakeholder Memo  
**Project:** S&P 500 Volume Seasonality Classification  

## Purpose  
This project looks at trading volume patterns in S&P 500 stocks to see whether certain months consistently have higher or lower volume. The goal is to give analysts and portfolio managers a clear view of seasonality across different sectors so they can plan ahead for times when liquidity is stronger or weaker.  

## Why It Matters  
Liquidity and trading volume directly affect how easily trades can be made. Seasonal shifts like spikes around earnings or major product launches can have a real impact on strategies. By spotting these patterns, decision-makers can better time their trades, focus on the right sectors at the right moments and avoid being caught off guard by sudden volume changes.  

## Approach  
We’ll use at least five years of historical daily price and volume data for S&P 500 companies. The data will be rolled up into monthly averages, then labeled as either “high volume” or “low volume” months. From there we’ll look at trends within sectors to see if industries follow consistent seasonal cycles.  

## Deliverables  
- **Descriptive insights:** A month by month breakdown of seasonal volume trends for selected stocks and sectors  
- **Predictive insights (later stage):** A model that classifies whether upcoming months are likely to be high or low volume based on past patterns  
- **Artifact:** An interactive dashboard where stakeholders can filter by stock, sector and timeframe to view both historical patterns and forward-looking predictions  

## Decision Window  
This work is useful on a monthly or quarterly cycle. Stakeholders don’t need real-time updates so they’ll use these insights when they review and adjust trading strategies for the next period.  

## Risks  
- Some sectors may not show strong or reliable seasonality  
- Historical data from free APIs may have gaps or inconsistencies  
- Newer companies might not have enough history to analyze  
- One-off events like mergers or shocks can distort monthly volumes
